Machine dubbed samples prepared for perception test. 

Legend: 
- **\_original**: Original English segment from dataset 
- **\_machineDub**: Machine translated and synced synthesis using our methodology
- **\_subtitleReading**: Synthesized Spanish subtitles with their starting times dictated by their original timestamps.

### Experiment 
18 Spanish speaking participants were asked to compare two machine dubbed versions of each sample in terms of (1) translation quality, and (2) lip-syncing precision. Also, they were asked which version they preferred for each sample. 

Mean opinion scores (MOS) results are shown in table:

| System           | Translation MOS | Lip-sync MOS | Preference |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Subtitle reading | 4.08            | 3.44         | %68        |
| Machine dubbing  | 2.96            | 3.58         | %32        |
